    "## What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.\n",

    "Docker architecture\n",
    "- Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing Docker containers.\n",
    "-  The client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.\n",
    "- Key Components : Docker daemon, Docker client, Docker registries, Docker objects\n"
